# Computer Odometer Version 2.0

Requires .NET Framework 3.0

Description:
This is a small program I've created to help myself learn some more about C# and using Visual Studio.
It acts like a car odometer. Put a speed under set speed in KM/h and it'll run at that precise speed.

The inspiration behind it is my love of cars and driving and I thought it'd be interesting to measure how many Kilometres I could've been driving instead
of making this!

Usage:
It's fairly straightforward but I'll explain it all anyway:
Set speed box: Sets the speed in KM/h. Should be able to accurately operate up to 1000KM/h (621mph)
Start button: Starts the Odometer.
Stop button: Stops the Odometer.
Load button: Loads the Odometer's reading on last Save.
Save button: Saves the Odometer's current reading.
Status Box: Tells you what operation the program is trying to do. (Running, stopped, saving etc etc)

Enjoy!
