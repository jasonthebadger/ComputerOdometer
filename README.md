# Computer Odometer Version 2.0

Requires .NET Framework 3.0

Description:
This is a small program I've created to help myself learn some more about C# and using Visual Studio.
It acts like a car odometer. Put a speed under set speed in KM/h and it'll run at that precise speed.

The inspiration behind it is my love of cars and driving and I thought it'd be interesting to measure how many Kilometres I could've been driving instead
of making this!

Usage:
It's fairly straightforward but I'll explain it all anyway:

Set speed box: Sets the speed in KM/h.

Start button: Starts the Odometer.

Stop button: Stops the Odometer.

Load button: Loads the Odometer's reading on last Save.

Save button: Saves the Odometer's current reading.

Status Box: Tells you what operation the program is trying to do. (Running, stopped, saving etc etc)

Random numbers on the LH side: Testing for proper operation. It's just a read-out in Metres so I could ensure the Odo/Trip were working as intended.
I will probably remove it if I decide to update this further (Maybe even do a MPH version?), Or feel free to remove it yourself via VS.

Enjoy!

Update 2.1

Fixed TripMeter doing strange things on Odometer Load. (only affected Compiled build, Source was not affected)

Odo/Trip not visible on certain machines - I believe I've fixed this issue. Will test tomorrow. I'm going to leave it as an 'Issue' until I've confirmed
it on a machine which has had the issue. UPDATE: Issue is fixed.
